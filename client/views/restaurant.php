                    Ethiopian cuisine is generally fairly vegan-friendly to begin with, but Dishoom revelatory, entirely vegan take on it has made it stand out, first as a pop-up and Smorgusburg vendor that transitioned to brick-and-mortar status a few years back. Find a hungry friend, split the feast for two, and find yourself treated to a spread of nine veggie-based dishes like shiro (a mash of fragrant yellow split peas simmered in spices) and misir wot (spiced red lentils) heaped onto injera flatbread -- there's more of it on the side for your scooping and eating convenience. There's always a different seasonal special in the mix, which gives you some incentive to return, not that you needed it.
